                <h1>Auth0 Sample Apps</h1>

                <p>
                    The purpose of this project is to help <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a> Developer Support Engineers spin-up, troubleshoot, and experiment with a variety of application they encounter daily. Work in progress
                </p>

                <h2>Flow</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to simplify deployment of sample apps, we create individual apps from Auth0 <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts">Quickstarts</a>, Guides, Tutorials and blog posts. We deploy each individual app with <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> with <i>netlify deploy --prod</i>, set DNS to point to the app, and add app's information to <a href="https://sanity.io">Sanity.io</a> (we use it as data store) at our <a href="https://dseapps.sanity.studio/desk">Sanity Studio</a> instance we also deploy for this project. With all this said and done, we have our main site showcase all the apps we have deployed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the main features here is a single-button deployment and Auth0 tenant settings in a `yaml` file (this file is a product of <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/deploy-cli/guides/install-deploy-cli">a0deploy CLI</a> export and it contains everything necessary to kickstart all apps we have deployed within 1 minute).
                </p>

                <h2>Stack and Tech</h2>

                <h3>Hosting</h3>

                <p>
                    We deploy to <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> — a fantastic <a href="https://jamstack.org">JAMstack</a> hosting. It's perfect for single-page apps and static websites. For apps that require a backed server (regular webapps), hosting solution TBD 🤷‍♂️
                </p>

                <h3>DSE Sample Apps Site</h3>

                <p>
                    The main site is powered by <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>, built on <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby Cloud</a> on every commit and whenever any data is updated in our Sanity database. The build is then deployed to <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> and usually is up and running at <a href="https://dse.netlify.app">dse.netlify.app</a> within 1-2 minutes. This CI/CD pipeline is already setup and doesn't require any tweaking at this time.
                </p>

                <h3>Sample Apps</h3>

                <p>
                    Each sample app lives in it's own folder within this project. These folders are ignored by Netlify deployment pipeline. Whenever a change made to one of the apps, we manually deploy this app with <i>netlify deploy --prod</i> (or <i>netlify deploy</i> if you just need a preview — learn more about <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/">Netlify CLI</a>). When these changes are committed, no new builds will happen (unless there's an update to the main DSE Sample Apps site)
                </p>

                <h3>Fun</h3>

                <p>
                    Netlify makes a screenshot of every site they deploy, and these screenshots are available through <a href="https://open-api.netlify.com/">Netlify API</a>. To make things fun, we fetch these screenshots for each sample app as a post-build Netlify hook. This hook calls a serverless function (learn more about <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/">Netlify Functions</a>) which retrieves the latest site screenshot, sends it to <a href="https://kraken.io">Kraken.io</a> for resizing and compressing, and then <a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/http-api-assets">sends</a> the resulting optimized image to our Sanity DB. As a result, our apps are always represented with the most current screenshot. Almost none of this actually works yet, but hey, work in progress, remember?
                </p>

                <h3>Auth0</h3>

                We are using <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a> for authentication and authorization (surprise!). Eventually, Auth0 DSEs will be able to tweak certain parameters of the apps they wish to single-click deploy. They will also be able to modify tenant parameters right from the app and export `yaml` right away.
